        Well, I think the most important thing to talk about now is surveillance. The sense that your environment, or that something -- that you don't know -- in your environment is watching you, is very, very old. It's been part of the world for centuries (ed.). You can look back at the late 19th century and find people who were spinning paranoid fantasies about people manipulating their minds through radio waves. Those kinds of marginal ideas have always been kind of hovering around technology. As we move through our day, as we say things, as we do things, we find ourselves suddenly self-censoring in ways that we hadn't before.
